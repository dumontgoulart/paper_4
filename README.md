## Scripts
Scripts Overview

    clim_functions.py: Contains functions for various climate data processing tasks, including wind calculations, storm tracking, and data visualization. It uses libraries such as xarray, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data manipulation and plotting.

    ECMWF_web_api_hg.py: This script appears to be set up for interacting with the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) web API, but does not define specific functions within the script. It imports ecmwfapi, numpy, pandas, and other modules, indicating its use for data retrieval and manipulation.

    fiat_run.py: Designed for operations related to the fiat library, which seems to be used for hydrological modeling. It includes functions for raster manipulation and relies on geopandas, shapely, rasterio, and hydromt among others.

    figure_animations.py: Provides functionalities to create animations from climate data sets, using matplotlib.animation, xarray, and cartopy for geospatial data visualization.

    sfincs_scenario_functions.py: Contains utilities for setting up, running, and manipulating outputs of the SFINCS (Simulation of Flood INundation of Coastal areas) model scenarios. It uses hydromt_sfincs, geopandas, and xarray for geographical data handling and analysis.

    sfincs_scenarios_analysis.py and sfincs_scenarios_setup.py: These scripts are part of the SFINCS model scenario analysis and setup processes. They include imports for data manipulation and geospatial analysis but do not contain specific functions within the provided content.

## Introduction

This collection of Python scripts is designed for researchers and scientists working in the field of climate science. It offers a range of functionalities, from processing climate data, interacting with the ECMWF web API, running hydrological models, to generating animations for data visualization. These tools are intended to assist in analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting climate-related data and model outputs.
Requirements

    Python 3.8 or later
    External Libraries: xarray, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, cartopy, metpy, seaborn, ecmwfapi, geopandas, shapely, rasterio, hydromt, hydromt_sfincs, configparser, yaml, glob, subprocess, datetime.

Ensure all dependencies are installed using pip or conda. Some libraries, like ecmwfapi, may require additional setup or API keys.
Installation

To set up your environment to run these scripts, follow these steps:

bash

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv climate_env
source climate_env/bin/activate

# Install required libraries
pip install xarray pandas numpy matplotlib scipy cartopy metpy seaborn ecmwf-api-client geopandas shapely rasterio

# Additional libraries specific to hydrological modeling
pip install hydromt hydromt_sfincs

Scripts Descriptions
clim_functions.py

Contains utility functions for climate data analysis, including wind calculation, storm tracking, and visualization tools. It's pivotal for preprocessing and analyzing climate datasets.
ECMWF_web_api_hg.py

Facilitates interaction with the ECMWF web API for retrieving weather forecast data. While it does not contain function definitions, it sets up a framework for API communication.
fiat_run.py

Provides functionalities related to the fiat hydrological model, including data preparation and manipulation tasks specific to hydrological analysis.
figure_animations.py

Enables the creation of animations from climate data, leveraging matplotlib.animation for dynamic data visualization.
sfincs_scenario_functions.py

Includes functions for setting up and running SFINCS model scenarios, with utilities for data clipping, model generation, and adaptation measure analysis.
sfincs_scenarios_analysis.py and sfincs_scenarios_setup.py

Part of the SFINCS model analysis toolkit, these scripts assist in the setup and analysis of model scenarios, focusing on flood inundation of coastal areas.
Usage

To use these scripts, import the necessary functions into your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks. Example usage for a specific function from clim_functions.py:

python

from clim_functions import plot_minimum_track
# Your code to load data
plot_minimum_track(data)
